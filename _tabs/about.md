## About Me

👋 Hey there! I'm a Computer Engineer and Cybersecurity Researcher passionate about application security, authentication systems, and ethical hacking. I like solving security challenges, breaking things (ethically, of course!), and sharing knowledge through CTF writeups and security research.


## 🎯 Why This Site?

I created this github.io page to document my journey in cybersecurity and help others understand security concepts through CTF writeups and technical blog posts. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced hacker, I hope you find something useful here!
