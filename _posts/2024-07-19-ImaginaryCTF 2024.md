## [FORENSIC] packed

> Packet Tracer is a cross-platform visual simulation tool designed by Cisco Systems that allows users to create network topologies and imitate modern computer networks. The software allows users to simulate the configuration of Cisco routers and switches using a simulated command line interface.

It turns out that .pkz works like a ZIP file. When the file is unzipped, the image of the flag can be extracted:

![Untitled](Untitled.png)

FLAG: `ictf{ab4697882634d4aeb6f21141ea2724d0}`

## [FORENSIC] **dog-mom**

For this challenge we are just given a photo of some place with amazing views:

![Untitled](Untitled%201.png)

First, I started with some Google Lens reverse searching:

![Untitled](Untitled%202.png)

This way I found an almost identical photo that was geolocated. It was took in the **Cathedral of Learning:** [https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cathedral+of+Learning/@40.4443635,-79.9537988,19z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x8834f2296ab3c26d:0xff131f1efe52e849!4m6!3m5!1s0x8834f228a3e31c8b:0xcb999890de87ffa6!8m2!3d40.4443625!4d-79.9531551!16zL20vMDM5ejJ3?entry=ttu](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cathedral+of+Learning/@40.4443635,-79.9537988,19z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x8834f2296ab3c26d:0xff131f1efe52e849!4m6!3m5!1s0x8834f228a3e31c8b:0xcb999890de87ffa6!8m2!3d40.4443625!4d-79.9531551!16zL20vMDM5ejJ3?entry=ttu)

The coordinates were: 40.444366580731334, -79.95316046454228. Rounded: 40.444, -79.953 →  ictf{40.444_-79.953}

However, this did not work so I had to brute-force a bit: ictf{40.444_-79.953}, ictf{40.444_-79.952}, ictf{40.444_-79.954}. This last worked.

FLAG: `ictf{40.444_-79.954}`

## [FORENSIC] **routed**

> Can you dig a bit deeper? (same attachment as packed)
>
> There are some fake flags; this is unintentional. The real flag is not in plaintext.

For this challenge we are given the same file than in the packed challenge (unzipping the file would reveal a flag file). However, this time it seems like it was more hidden.

This is why I launched CPT and start digging in the project. Apart from rapidly checking the configuration of all devices, I took a look at other sections that could help me to retrieve more info. That’s how I discovered the IOS Command Log:

![Untitled](Untitled%203.png)

Here all the commands used for setting up the project were logged. There were several attemps of setting passwords, however these were fake. The last one (`020F074F0D1D0728484A0C173A191D1F330C2B382C2D3728`) was the correct , but I did not know how the command worked, so I searched it.

Searching up `cisco password 7` I found several pages that were used to decrypt it so I used one: [https://www.firewall.cx/cisco/cisco-routers/cisco-type7-password-crack.html](https://www.firewall.cx/cisco/cisco-routers/cisco-type7-password-crack.html)

![Untitled](Untitled%204.png)

And just with that I managed to get the password, which was also the flag.

FLAG: `ictf{hidden_not_hashed}`

## [FORENSIC] **crash**

> I didn't save my work…

> Files: dump.vmem
> 

We are given a dump file of some crash, as the title suggest… So I prepared Volatily 3.

First, I listed the running process there I found that `notepad.txt` was opened:

```

```

Then I searched up how to extract information from notepad, there I found this plugin: [https://github.com/spitfirerxf/vol3-plugins](https://github.com/spitfirerxf/vol3-plugins).
With that I manage to get some hints, several references to `flag.txt`:

```

```

![Untitled](Untitled%205.png)

Now I wanted to check if the file was really there, so I performed a file scan and filtered by the filename:

```
└─$ python3 ~/volatility3/vol.py -f dump.vmem  windows.filescan | grep flag          
0xc60c81c70ce0.0\Users\imaginarypc\Documents\flag.txt   216
0xc60c81c7c540  \Users\imaginarypc\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\flag.lnk    216
```

Finally, I extracted the file contents now that I had the virtual address:

```
└─$ python3 ~/volatility3/vol.py -f dump.vmem  -o ./ windows.dumpfiles --virtaddr 0xc60c81c70ce0

```

As we see, the flag is base64-encoded.

FLAG: `ictf{aa0eb707a41b2ca6}`

## [FORENSIC] **cartesian-1**

> Greetings. You have been tasked with investigating the whereabouts of a potential recruit. To perform this top-secret background check, we must gather as much information as possible.
>
> Please investigate Terrence Descartes. We know that his social accounts are relatively new, so please do not attack anything out of scope. For the sake of this series of challenges, nothing pertaining to Terry has existed before July 17, 2024. Do not investigate anything posted online before then.
> 

I started by searching up his name in the most popular platforms, finding his Instagram profile:

[https://www.instagram.com/descartes.terry2001/](https://www.instagram.com/descartes.terry2001/)

![Untitled](Untitled%206.png)

He had some Stories about his winter travel to NYC and also one with the flag text:

![Untitled](Untitled%207.png)

FLAG: `ictf{i_love_revealing_info_on_the_internet}`

## [FORENSIC] **cartesian-2**

> THIS IS AN OSINT CHALLENGE.
>
> Please keep digging into Descartes. We have reason to suspect that 
there might be more to him that it seems. Look into his trip last 
summer. See if you can find anything up with him.
>
> Update - 7/20/24 00:25 UTC: The challenges `cartesian-2` and `cartesian-3`
 have been updated. Terrence has posted information online that will be 
relevant in solving these challenges. I apologize for the oversight.
> 

For this challenge we are given very little information about the next steps, we are told to search for information about his summer trip. However, in his Instagram profile there are just photos about his winter trip, so I tried to search in more platforms.

This is how I found his LinkedIn profile:

[https://www.linkedin.com/in/terrence-descartes-54642831a/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/terrence-descartes-54642831a/)

![Untitled](Untitled%208.png)

![Untitled](Untitled%209.png)

With this LinkedIn post I obtained the first part of this flag `ictf{wh3n_th3y_s4y_publ1c_`.

This post was also a major hint, he owned a Google account. So it may was possible to extract more info from him on that account. 

However, I needed his email but I couldn’t find it. At this point, I requested ChatGPT to perform popular permutations based on its name and username and I bruteforced these with GHunt.

Finally I got something with `terrence.descartes@gmail.com`:

```

The output of GHunt gives more resources about him: the reviews link (empty) and a public calendar. The ICS content was the following:

Here we finally find the second part of the flag: `th3y_m3an_publ1c_9f1b2314}`, which we can append to the first one.

FLAG:  `ictf{wh3n_th3y_s4y_publ1c_th3y_m3an_publ1c_9f1b2314}`

## [FORENSIC] **cartesian-3**

> THIS IS AN OSINT CHALLENGE.
>
> We have reason to believe that Terrence is up to no good... we need 
to gather evidence. To do that, we need you to reset his password so we 
can have access to his accounts. With all the research you've done, it 
should be done in no time!
>
> Update - 7/20/24 00:25 UTC: The challenges `cartesian-2` and `cartesian-3`
 have been updated. Terrence has posted information online that will be 
relevant in solving these challenges. I apologize for the oversight.
> 

This time we are presented with a page which has the following fields to “recover” Terrence’s password, so I went and try to recover as much information as possible for each of the fields (I had many already):

### What is your email?

Here I had several candidates as the last challenge revealed two emails:

- The one which retrieved the ICS: terrence.descartes@gmail.com
- The 1st in the ICS: terrencedescartes@gmail.com

The second worked: `terrencedescartes@gmail.com`

### On what day were you born?

For this question I had to go back to his Instagram profile.

The year is quite easy as we can guess it with the username (descartes.terry2001): 2001.

For the month and the day I had to review his photos. It turns out that he has a “Birthday” photo in which he reveals some hints. Quote:

> half birthday vibes 🎂🎂🎂 really bringing back those memories from January
> 

So knowing that the the photo was posted in 19/07 (today) and he says “half birthday” we can guess that the day and the month are: 19/01.

Mixing these evidences, the final date is 19/01/2001, in the correct format: 2001-01-19. However, when checking this, it was not correct, so I tried a day before and worked: `2001-01-18`

### What is the name of your favorite pet?

The answer to this question resides in another Instagram post where the caption is:

> besties 4 life 🐶🐶🐶 ilysm bonnie
> 

So this was easy: `bonnie`.

### What city have you primarily lived in for the past three months?

To answer this I went to the Linkedin profile. There the profile shows that he is living in `San Diego`.

### In what city did you grow up?

This was a little bit trickier.

In the Instagram page I saw that he was following a middle school from Los Angeles and the time zone in the ICS was also set in that city, however it was not correct.

Then went again to the Instagram profile as I remembered seeing something about his home there. So it was, there was a post with his car where the caption is:

> finally free from my last summer classes! omw only 300 miles till I get home
> 

Also in the ICS we can see another reference to “home” in the NYC trip event: `2139 miles away from my hometown... so far away.`

With this information we can pinpoint the city. In my case I used [https://www.mapdevelopers.com/draw-circle-tool.php](https://www.mapdevelopers.com/draw-circle-tool.php) to draw two circles: One with a radius of 300 miles long in San Diego and another with 2139 miles in NYC. With that, we obtain a perfect intersection in the map:

So the city was `Phoenix`.

### What is the name of your favorite poet?

This was really easy, he has references in all his account, the most obvious is that he follows a lot of fan accounts of `Robert Frost` in Instagram:

### What was the make and model of your first car?

This was easy for me as I knew the model. It is shown in one of the posts:

![Untitled](Untitled%2012.png)

It’s a `Honda Civic`. Concretely the type R (but is not necessary).

### In what year was your father born?

As I did not have any info about this, I did quick maths and statistics. The earliest age at which the father could have been father would be around ~16, so I started at 1985 and kept lowering the year.

After some tries, `1981` did the job.

### What is your mother's maiden name?

This was also very easy, it is mentioned in the LinkedIn post where he says the name of his mother: Amelia Jackson Descartes. So the answer is Jackson.

### At what company do you work at?

It’s in his LinkedIn: Cohort Calculations.

### In what city did you go on vacation last summer

In his LinkedIn there is the post about the removed review and his last summer vacations. There, in the left side we can see a small icon with the words: Como Park Zoo & …:

![Untitled](Untitled%2013.png)

I searched up this place and was located in `Saint Paul`.

### What are you supposed to do on August 21?

This is shown in the ICS: `Drop off top secret information`.

### Who was your boss in your first job?

This is shown in his LinkedIn. As he worked at Farmer Johnson's Goose Company, the boss is `Farmer Johnson`.

### Submission

After all this, I submitted the all the form and the flag was retrieved.

FLAG: `ictf{pls_stay_safe_out_there_e072db31b690cfdb}`

## [FORENSIC] **playful-puppy**

> I lost my dog in Minecraft. Can you find him? The name of the dog wrapped in `ictf{}` is the flag.

For this challenge we are given the photo of the dog (`image.png`) and a ZIP file (`playful-puppy.zip`) that contains a Minecraft world. The photo of the dog was this:

Knowing this, the first thing that I did was to open the world in Minecraft. I did so by copying the `world` folder and pasting it in the `AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\saves folder`:

To my surprise, there were thousands of wolves, but I didn’t want to check them all. That is why after checking the zone try to discover more things (I just saw an irrelevant pile of anvils), I began to investigate the data in the world folder.

In the `datapacks\Dog data\data\test\function` folder I found the `dog.mcfunction` file:

```
summon minecraft:wolf ~ ~ ~ {CustomName:bf25e944bee0fa99,Owner:cleverbear57,CustomNameVisible:0,variant:pale,CollarColor:1}
summon minecraft:wolf ~ ~ ~ {CustomName:817bf6d52f2c358c,Owner:cleverbear57,CustomNameVisible:0,variant:woods,CollarColor:2}
summon minecraft:wolf ~ ~ ~ {CustomName:ae4dd4b26ad34509,Owner:cleverbear57,CustomNameVisible:0,variant:ashen,CollarColor:3}
...
```

This was apparently the function used to spawn all the wolves. However, after filtering by the black ones and bruteforcing with the name, none of them matched the flag.

At this point I changed my approach: just let’s change the function so it kills all the mobs in the file. So I took the function file and performed a replacing with the following regex: `summon minecraft:wolf ~ ~ ~ {(.*?):(.*?),.*}` → `kill @e[nbt={$1:'"$2"'}]`:

```
kill @e[nbt={CustomName:'"bf25e944bee0fa99"'}]
kill @e[nbt={CustomName:'"817bf6d52f2c358c"'}]
kill @e[nbt={CustomName:'"ae4dd4b26ad34509"'}]
...
```

With this new function, all the summoned wolves started disappearing when I executed: `/function test:dog`.

Only 3 wolves were left, but the black was the correct one.

FLAG: `ictf{6ed247d7539bb3bf}`
