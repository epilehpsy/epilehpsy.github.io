I loved the theming of the CTF. Sadly, I could just focus in OSINT as I didn’t have time for any more *investigations* in other categories. Let’s begin.


## [OSINT] Hip With the Youth

> The Long Island Subway Authority (LISA), in an attempt to appeal to the younger generations, has begun experimenting with social media! See if you can find a way to a flag through their Instagram.
This is part one of a three-part OSINT suite including Hip With the Youth, An Unlikely Partnership, and The Weakest Link. I recommend starting here!
> 

We are given a very good hint to start: Instagram. With this I found the Instagram profile easily:

[https://www.instagram.com/longislandsubwayauthority/](https://www.instagram.com/longislandsubwayauthority/)

However, this profile hadn’t any hint or flag in any of the photos or descriptions, but the Threads profile was linked: 

[https://www.threads.net/@longislandsubwayauthority](https://www.threads.net/@longislandsubwayauthority)

After reading all the comments and post I manage to see the flag in one of the comments:

[https://www.threads.net/@longislandsubwayauthority/post/C8tAsAWRdIx](https://www.threads.net/@longislandsubwayauthority/post/C8tAsAWRdIx)

## [OSINT] An Unlikely Partnership

> It appears that the Long Island Subway Authority (LISA) has made a strategic business partnership with a surprise influencer! See if you can figure out who.
This is part two of a three-part OSINT suite including Hip With the Youth, An Unlikely Partnership, and The Weakest Link. This challenge is possible without Hip With the Youth but will be easier if you start there.
> 

The challenge continues from the last finding, so I took a better look at the Thread profile and found the link to its LinkedIn profile:

[https://www.threads.net/@longislandsubwayauthority](https://www.threads.net/@longislandsubwayauthority)

In its LinkedIn I did not finding anything useful at first with any of the posts. However, I found that someone had validated the Transportation skill in its profile:

![Untitled](Untitled%202.png)

[https://www.linkedin.com/in/uiuc-chan/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/uiuc-chan/)

This was UIUC Chan, the *surprise influencer* who was mentioned in the description. Once the profile was discovered, the flag could be seen in its *About Me* section.

## [OSINT] The Weakest Link

> LISA and the secret business partner have a secret Spotify collaboration planned together. Unfortunately, neither of them have the opsec to keep it private. See if you can figure out what it is!
This is part three of a three-part OSINT suite including Hip With the Youth, An Unlikely Partnership, and The Weakest Link. I recommend starting with the other two challenges!
> 

From here I kept digging in its profile and found a link in its *Contact Info* section (The Weakest Link do you get it?)

![Untitled](Untitled%204.png)

[https://open.spotify.com/user/31d2lcivqdieyl4qzx25vfmp6jt4?si=b769b2466f7e4101](https://open.spotify.com/user/31d2lcivqdieyl4qzx25vfmp6jt4?si=b769b2466f7e4101)

From here I keept investigating the linked Spotify profile. Sadly, I did not saw any more things apart from its public playlist and its name.

![Untitled](Untitled%205.png)

So, I went back in search of any other hint that could be in the LinkedIn profile. At some point I re-read the description: *I love music! I quite literally play it at all times*… Here I got the eureka moment and followed the profile. In the Friend Activity section, I could see that the profile was listening to a new playlist (this in part explain the high followers count, in contrast to the other profiles).

![Untitled](Untitled%206.png)

[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1J2aZwN25HyZT7viJsNkxS?si=be4fc0e4fa494067](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1J2aZwN25HyZT7viJsNkxS?si=be4fc0e4fa494067)

The flag was in the description of the playlist.

## [OSINT] Night

> That was quite a pretty night view, can you find where I took it? Flag format: uiuctf{street name, city name} Example: uiuctf{East Green Street, Champaign}
Some words are blurred out to make the challenge harder, hopefully.
Flag format clarification: Use the full type, e.g. Avenue, Street, Road, etc., and include a space between the comma and city name.

For this independent challenge we are given just an image:

![chal.jpg](chal.jpg)

With the power of Google Lens I managed to know that we were in Boston, concretely near the Prudential Tower:

![Untitled](Untitled%208.png)

In the map, near this tower, there were two railway tracks running near the highway (as in the image). However, only one zone had the railway to the left while looking towards the tower, so the searching zone was pretty much reduced:

![Untitled](Untitled%209.png)

Once the road was found, the only thing left was to find the ramp that appeared in the image with Street View:

![Untitled](Untitled%2010.png)

The location was: 157 Arlington St Boston, Massachusetts (42.347989, -71.069109)

FLAG: `uiuctf{Arlington Street, Boston}`

## [OSINT] Chunky Boi

> Now that's a BIG plane! I wonder where it is. Flag format: uiuctf{plane type, coordinates of the aircraft} Example: uiuctf{Airbus A380-800, 40.036, -88.264}
For coordinates, just omit the digits, do not round up. Precision is the same as the one in the example. The aircraft name is the same as Wikipedia page title. You can extract enough information from this image to answer this. You DO NOT need to register any accounts, all the information is public.
Flag format clarification: The last digit of the first coordinate is even, and the last digit of the second coordinate is odd.

The plane looks like an **Boeing C-17 Globemaster III**, so we have half of the challenge. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_C-17_Globemaster_III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_C-17_Globemaster_III)

The only thing left is to get the location, let’s search for the airport. However, the search for the military plane is not easy, and did not turn out well. Also, a reverse search of the image to search the airport did not returned interesting. However, as there were 2 other planes, it wanted to see the company:

![Untitled](Untitled%2012.png)

Now I know that this is some airport in which Alaska Airlines operates, and I could research that in FlightRadar: [https://www.flightradar24.com/data/airlines/as-asa/routes](https://www.flightradar24.com/data/airlines/as-asa/routes)

![Untitled](Untitled%2013.png)

There were a lot of airports here but I tried to start with the most used by the company, which is Seatle (here the idea was to at least try to research the top 5 most “used”: Seattle, Portland, San Francisco…): 

![Untitled](Untitled%2014.png)

At this airport, the circled part took my attention as it followed a similar display as the image by the buildings and the nearby vegetation. When I zoomed and tilted the map I saw that this was in fact the place:

Once the coordinates were obtained, the challenge was solved.

FLAG: `uiuctf{Boeing C-17 Globemaster III**,** 47.462, -122.303}`
